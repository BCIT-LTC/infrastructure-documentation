# What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is a workload orchestration system that administers services on a cluster of servers. Generally, the servers are virtual machines (VM's) working together to create services for users.

Kubernetes monitors, schedules, and manages workloads so they are highly available.

## RKE2

[SUSE Rancher RKE2](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/) is the flavour of Kubernetes we use to create Kubernetes clusters. It was chosen because it is open-source, free, and relatively easy to operate and use.

The VM's in a cluster are called **nodes**, and nodes can have different **roles** depending on the type of cluster.

## Rancher

Rancher is a graphical interface for Kubernetes that allows us to administer each of the clusters from a central platform.
