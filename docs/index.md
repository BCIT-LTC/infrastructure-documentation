The LTC has been hosting blogs, multimedia assets, simple websites, and full database-driven applications since 2010. As the demands for technical services grow our infrastructure has required renewal and operational maintenance.

In 2021 the Course Production team underook a large project to re-design and renew the LTC's aging infrastructure. The project had the following goals:

* To replace aging, single-machine `test` and `production` deployment servers
* To create more *industry-standard* environments and deployment endpoints
* To ensure infrastructure maintenance is straightforward and relatively easy
* To ensure growth potential
* To avoid vendor lock-in
* To facilitate a contemporary development workflow that uses containers/images
* To minimize costs

The LTC now has a modern, highly-available collection of systems that provide the department with the capability to deliver contemporary educational resources to the institute.

!!! note "The LTC..."

    * practices infrastructure as code (IaC) and uses CI/CD pipelines to limit manual deployment and configuration
    * configures infrastructure through the files in the "LTC Infrastructure" group of projects

    By using configuration files and recording their changes in a version control system over, we are better able to know what has been installed, where, and when something was last updated (operational awareness).
