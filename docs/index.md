The Learning and Teaching Centre (LTC) has a collection of modern, highly-available systems that provide the capability to deliver agile software solutions to the BCIT community.

We:

* use CI/CD pipelines to automate deployments
* deploy containerized workloads to Kubernetes
* practice infrastructure as code (IaC) to store and track configuration
* monitor and log workloads to minimize and respond to service interruptions
