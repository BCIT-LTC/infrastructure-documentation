# LTC GitLab CI/CD Source Project Pipeline
#
## Requirements
#   - this file
#   - a working `Dockerfile`
#   - a `deploy/` folder with Kubernetes resources
#
## General Pipeline Steps
#   1. Gather info
#   2. Build image
#   3. FluxCD deploys resources to a cluster
#     - dev branches          => https://review--{branchName}--{projectName}.ltc.bcit.ca/ => review cluster
#     - main branch           => https://latest--{projectName}.ltc.bcit.ca/               => latest cluster
#     - tagged commit on main => https://{projectName}.ltc.bcit.ca/                       => stable cluster
#
stages:
  - get info
  - test
  - build
  - verify review requirements
  - review
  - cleanup


## Project initialization
#   - a project access token is required; if it doesn't exist it is created on the first run
# project init:
#   stage: get info
#   extends:
#     - ".project_init"


# Determine target environment, deployment namespace, and ingress/app url
#
get environment info:
  stage: get info
  extends:
    - ".get_env"


# Retrieve and set git/image tags
#
get tags:
  stage: get info
  extends:
    - ".get_tags"


# Determine if a new git tag and GitLab release should be created
#
run semantic release:
  stage: get info
  extends:
    - ".get_next_version"


# Build image and push to project registry
#
build image:
  stage: build
  extends:
    - ".build_image"
    - ".build_image_rules"


## For `review` environments only: build a configuration image and push to the project registry
#
build review config image:
  stage: build
  extends:
    - ".build_review_config_image"
    - ".review_rules"


## For `review` environments only: verify the required namespace exists
#
verify namespace:
  stage: verify review requirements
  extends:
    - ".verify_namespace"
    - ".review_rules"


## For `review` environments only: verify the required TLS Ingress secret exists
#
verify secrets:
  stage: verify review requirements
  extends:
    - ".verify_secrets"
    - ".review_rules"


## For `review` environments only: verify the required `deploy-vars` ConfigMap exists
#
apply review configmap :
  stage: verify review requirements
  extends:
    - ".apply_review_configmap"
    - ".review_rules"


# # For `review` environments only: deploy project for review.
# #
# review:
#   extends:
#     - ".review"
#     - ".review_rules"


# # For `review` environments only: gracefully remove `review` environment after 1 week.
# #
# stop review:
#   extends:
#     - ".stop_review"
#     - ".stop_review_rules"


# Other default pipeline configuration values
#
variables:
  #
  # other global variables are set in GitLab Admin
  #
  # GENERIC_DEPLOYMENT: "true"
  #
  #   - if GENERIC_DEPLOYMENT is set to anything but "true", the pipeline expects this
  #     project to have a `deploy/` folder. See https://infrastructure-documentation.ltc.bcit.ca/.
  #
  # Set COMMON_NAMESPACE to combine apps into one namespace
  #
  # COMMON_NAMESPACE: ""
  #
  # Set SKIP_BUILD to skip the build stage and deploy the latest image
  #
  # SKIP_BUILD: "true"
  #
  # Turn on verbose debugging console output
  #
  PIPELINE_DEBUG: "true"


# Include common pipeline scripts
#
include:
  - project: deployments/ci-config
    file:
      - build.yaml
      - common.yaml
      - get-env.yaml
      - get-tags.yaml
      # - project-init.yml
      - review.yaml
      - rules.yaml
      - semantic-release.yaml
      - verify.yaml
  # - template: Jobs/Secret-Detection.gitlab-ci.yml
  # - template: Jobs/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml


# Specify which GitLab Runner should pick up pipeline jobs
#
default:
  tags:
    - review


# Cache pipeline jobs based on branch
#
cache:
  key: $CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG


# Configure Static Application Security Test scanning
#
# sast:
#   stage: test
#   extends:
#     - ".deploy_stable_rules"


# Configure jobs for GitLab merge request pipelines
#
workflow:
  rules:
    # - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH && $CI_OPEN_MERGE_REQUESTS && $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "push"
    #   when: never
    - if: "$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH && $CI_OPEN_MERGE_REQUESTS"
      when: never
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event" || $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH || $CI_COMMIT_TAG
